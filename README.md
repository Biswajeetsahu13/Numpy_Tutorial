# Numpy_Tutorial
Objective:
To explore the core functionalities of the NumPy library for numerical computing, including array creation, indexing, and statistical operations.
Libraries Used:
•	numpy
Workflow:
1.	Data Collection
o	Created arrays manually or by importing data from external sources.
2.	Array Operations
o	Performed element-wise operations on arrays (e.g., addition, multiplication).
3.	Statistical Functions
o	Used functions like mean, median, and standard deviation to analyze arrays.
Results:
•	NumPy allows efficient computation with large datasets and performs operations much faster than traditional Python lists.
Conclusion:
NumPy’s array operations are critical for numerical tasks in Python, offering vast speed improvements over standard Python lists.
Future Work:
•	Explore advanced techniques like broadcasting and linear algebra functions in NumPy.
